        <h2 class="text-center text-primary">Overview</h2>
        <p>The Tatras are a mountain range of a corrugated nature, originating from the Alpine orogeny, and therefore characterized by a relatively young-looking lay of the land, quite similar to the landscape of the Alps, although significantly smaller. It is the highest mountain range within Carpathians. <br>It consists of the internal mountain chains of:<br>

  Western Tatras and Eastern Tatras which in turn consist of:<br>
  the High Tatras and Belianske Tatras. <br>
  The overall nature of the Tatras, together with their easy accessibility, makes them a favorite with tourists and researchers. Therefore, these mountains are a popular winter sports area. The High Tatras, with their 24 (or 25) peaks exceeding 2,500 m above sea level, together with the Southern Carpathians, represent the only form of alpine landscape in the entire 1,200 kilometres (746 miles) length of arc of the Carpathians.</p>

          <h2 class="text-center text-primary">Trails</h2>
          <p>Orla Perć is considered the most difficult and dangerous mountain trail in the entire Tatras, a suitable destination only for experienced tourists and climbers. It lies exclusively within the Polish part of the Tatras. More than one hundred individuals have lost their lives on the route since it was first established. The path is marked with red signs.<br>

  The highest point in the Tatra Mountains that can be freely accessed by a labeled trail is Rysy.<br>

  Most of the peaks in the Western Tatras (on both sides of the border) including the main ridge are freely accessible by hiking trails. In the Slovak part of the Eastern Tatras, only 7 peaks (out of 48 with prominence of at least 100 m) are accessible by hiking trails. Two of these (Rysy and Svinica/Świnica) are located on the border with Poland and also accessible from the Polish side. The rest of the peaks on the Slovak side can only be accessed when accompanied by a certified mountain guide. UIAA members can climb them also without a certified guide, but not using the normal (easiest) routes (from the III degree of difficulty).<br>
  In the Slovak part most of the hiking trails in the Tatras are closed from 1 November to 15 June. Only trails from settlements up to the part mountain huts are open. In Poland, the trails are open year-round.

         <h2 class="text-center text-primary">Climate</h2>
        <p>The Tatras lie in the temperate zone of Central Europe. They are an important barrier to the movements of air masses. Their mountainous topography causes one of the most diverse climates in that region.<br><br>
          <strong>Winds</strong><br>
  The average wind speed on the summits is 6 m/s.<br>
  &#8226; southerly winds on the northern side<br>
  &#8226; westerly winds at the base of Tatra (Orava-Nowy Targ Basin)<br>
  &#8226; foehn winds (Polish: halny) most often occur between October and May. They are warm and dry and can cause extensive damage.<br>
  &#8226; Maximum wind speed 288 km/h (179 mph) (6 May 1968).[7]<br><br>

  <strong>Temperature</strong><br>
  Temperatures range from −40 °C (−40 °F) in the winter to 33 °C (91 °F) in warmer months. Temperatures also vary depending on altitude and sun exposure of a given slope. Temperatures below 0 °C (32 °F) last for 192 days on the summits.<br><br>
  <strong>Precipitation</strong><br>
  Highest precipitation figures are recorded on the northern slopes. In June and July monthly precipitation reaches around 250 mm (10 in). Precipitation occurs from 215 to 228 days a year. Thunderstorms occur 36 days a year on average.<br><br>
  <strong>Snow cover</strong><br>
  Maximum thickness on the summit amounts to:<br>
  &#8226; in Slovakia - Lomnický Štít: 410 cm (161 in)<br>
  &#8226; in Poland - Kasprowy Wierch: 355 cm (140 in)<br>

  Peaks are sometimes covered with snow or ice throughout the year. Avalanches are frequent.

         <h2 class="text-center text-primary">Flora & Fauna</h2>
        <p><strong>Flora</strong><br>
          The Tatra Mountains have a diverse variety of plant life. They are home to more than 1,000 species of vascular plants, about 450 mosses, 200 liverworts, 700 lichens, 900 fungi, and 70 slime moulds. There are five climatic-vegetation belts in the Tatras.<br><br>

  The distribution of plants depends on altitude:<br>
  &#8226; up to 1,300 m: Carpathian beech forest; almost no shrub layer, herbaceous layer occupies most of the forest floor<br>
  &#8226; to 1,550 m: Spruce forest; shrub layer poorly developed, mosses are a major component<br>
  &#8226; to 1,800 m: Mountain Pine, numerous herbs<br>
  &#8226; to 2,300 m: high altitude grasslands<br>
  &#8226; from 2,300 m up: Subnivean - bare rock and almost no vegetation (mostly lichens)<br><br>
          <strong>Fauna</strong><br>
          The Tatra Mountains are home to many species of animals: 54 tardigrades, 22 turbellarians, 100 rotifers, 22 copepods, 162 spiders, 81 molluscs, 43 mammals, 200 birds, 7 amphibians and 2 reptiles.<br>

  The most notable mammals are the Tatra chamois, marmot, snow vole, brown bear, wolf, Eurasian lynx, red deer, roe deer, and wild boar. Notable fish include the brown trout and alpine bullhead.<br>

  The endemic arthropod species include a caddis fly, spider Xysticus alpicola[8] and a springtail. <br><br>
